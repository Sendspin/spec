## Establishing a Connection

Sendspin has two standard ways to establish connections: Server and Client initiated. Server Initiated connections are RECOMMENDED as they provide standardized multi-server behavior.

Servers MUST support both methods described below. Clients MUST use exactly one of the two methods at a time, advertising or discovering accordingly.

The WebSocket transport MUST be plain `ws://`. Confidentiality and integrity are provided end to end by the [Noise layer](#encryption) inside the WebSocket payloads.

### Server Initiated Connections

Clients announce their presence via mDNS using:
- Service type: `_sendspin._tcp.local.`
- Port: The port the Sendspin client is listening on (recommended: `8928`)
- TXT record: `path` key specifying the WebSocket endpoint, REQUIRED (recommended value: `/sendspin`)
- TXT record: `name` key specifying the friendly name of the client (OPTIONAL)

The server discovers available clients through mDNS and connects to each client via WebSocket using the advertised address and path.

The TXT `name` SHOULD match the `name` the client sends in [`client/hello`](messaging.md#client--server-clienthello). It is only a discovery-time hint; if the two differ, the `client/hello` value is authoritative.

Clients MUST NOT manually connect to servers while advertising `_sendspin._tcp`.

#### Multiple servers (server-initiated)

A client holds at most one admitted connection at a time, except where noted below, classified by the highest-ranked activity in its declared [`activities`](messaging.md#server--client-serveractivate); from highest to lowest:

- `'playback'`
- `'pairing'`

A connection with empty `activities` ranks lowest.

Clients MUST persistently store the `server_id` of the server that most recently held the admitted connection while `'playback'` was among its `activities` (the "last-playback server").

When a new server connects, the client lets the handshake complete before applying admission; the new connection is provisional until its first [`server/activate`](messaging.md#server--client-serveractivate) declares its priority. The client MUST NOT apply the priority rules to an activation that is not [admissible](messaging.md#server--client-serveractivate). The incoming connection's priority is compared to the current connection's: higher or equal is accepted, lower is rejected. Three exceptions:

- A [pairing attempt](pairing.md#entering-and-leaving-pairing) is not displaced by an incoming `'playback'` or `'pairing'` connection.
- When both the current holder and the incoming connection have empty `activities`, the incoming is admitted only if its `server_id` matches the last-playback server (and the existing one's does not); otherwise the existing is kept.
- A client MAY admit one incoming `'pairing'` connection alongside the admitted `'playback'` connection, holding both. A client that does not admit both connections rejects the incoming with [`pair/abort`](pairing.md#client--server-pairabort) reason `concurrent_attempt` and closes the connection. While both are held, further incoming connections are arbitrated against the `'playback'` holder. When a later `server/activate` drops `'pairing'` from that connection's `activities`, the client arbitrates it against the `'playback'` holder as if it were incoming.

Subsequent `server/activate` updates do not otherwise trigger arbitration, even when a connection escalates its activities. A provisional connection that has not sent `server/activate` within 30 seconds is dropped. Clients MAY cap how many provisional connections they hold at once, rejecting further incoming connections as if they were lower priority.

A displaced connection receives [`client/goodbye`](messaging.md#client--server-clientgoodbye) reason `'another_server'` (or [`pair/abort`](pairing.md#client--server-pairabort) reason `concurrent_attempt` if it is a pairing handshake). A rejected incoming receives [`client/goodbye`](messaging.md#client--server-clientgoodbye) reason `'concurrent_attempt'` (or [`pair/abort`](pairing.md#client--server-pairabort) reason `concurrent_attempt` for pairings). The client then closes the connection.

### Client Initiated Connections

If clients prefer to initiate the connection instead of waiting for the server to connect, the server MUST be discoverable via mDNS using:
- Service type: `_sendspin-server._tcp.local.`
- Port: The port the Sendspin server is listening on (recommended: `8927`)
- TXT record: `path` key specifying the WebSocket endpoint, REQUIRED (recommended value: `/sendspin`)
- TXT record: `name` key specifying the friendly name of the server (OPTIONAL)

Clients discover the server through mDNS and initiate a WebSocket connection using the advertised address and path.

The TXT `name` SHOULD match the `name` the server sends in [`server/hello`](messaging.md#server--client-serverhello). It is only a discovery-time hint; if the two differ, the `server/hello` value is authoritative.

Clients MUST NOT advertise `_sendspin._tcp` while using client-initiated connections.

#### Multiple servers (client-initiated)

Unlike server-initiated connections, servers cannot reclaim clients by reconnecting. How clients handle multiple discovered servers, server selection, and switching is implementation-defined.

**Note:** After this point, Sendspin works independently of how the connection was established.

## Encryption

All Sendspin connections use end-to-end encryption based on the [Noise Protocol Framework](https://noiseprotocol.org/noise.html).

### Pattern

Sendspin uses the `KKpsk2` Noise pattern. Both static keys are pre-known to both parties (the `client_id` of the client and the `server_id` of the server are the static public keys), and a [Pre-Shared Key](#pre-shared-key) is mixed in at the end of the handshake's second message.

The **server is the Noise initiator**, the **client is the Noise responder**, regardless of which side initiated the WebSocket connection.

**Security properties.** Forward secrecy is provided by the ephemeral-key DH in each handshake: compromise of static keys or the PSK does not retroactively decrypt prior sessions' transport traffic (the exception is the first handshake message's payload, recoverable with the client's static key). Replay protection is provided by Noise's per-direction transport counter; a repeated or out-of-order ciphertext fails AEAD decryption and aborts the connection.

### Cipher Suites

A suite specifies the `<DH>_<cipher>_<hash>` part of the full Noise protocol name. Sendspin defines two:

- `25519_ChaChaPoly_SHA256` - software-friendly suite
- `25519_AESGCM_SHA256` - hardware-accelerated suite (AES-NI / ARMv8 Crypto Extensions)

Servers MUST support both suites. Clients MUST support at least one.

The client picks one suite and announces it in [`client/init`](messaging.md#client--server-clientinit); since servers are required to support every suite, no negotiation is needed.

### Identities

The `client_id` and `server_id` fields are the base64url-encoded (no padding) Curve25519 public keys of the client and server respectively, 43 characters each. These keys serve both as routing/persistence identifiers and as the static keys used in the Noise handshake. The private keys MUST be drawn from a [CSPRNG](README.md#definitions) per device and MUST NOT be a fixed default shared across devices.

**Key rotation.** Each side's static keypair is intended to be long-lived; the identifier is the pubkey, so rotating the keypair changes the identity. A server that rotates its static keypair (e.g., reprovisioned hardware, migrated host, lost private key) appears to clients as a different server. Operators who want to preserve identity across server moves must preserve the server's static private key (e.g., as part of the server's backup/restore set).

### Pre-Shared Key

The PSK is mixed into the handshake state at the end of the second handshake message (the `psk2` modifier). The transport-mode keys derived after the handshake therefore include the PSK, but the first handshake message's payload (sent by the server) is encrypted without the PSK mixed in.

To let the client select the right PSK before the PSK must be mixed in, the server includes a `psk_id` and a `psk_category` in the first handshake message's payload. The identifier is a 43-character base64url-encoded value (no padding) of a 32-byte SHA-256 output, derived deterministically from the PSK:

```
psk_id = base64url(SHA-256("sendspin-psk-id-v1" || PSK))
```

The label is the UTF-8 byte sequence of the literal characters shown (no NUL terminator, no surrounding quotes); `||` denotes byte concatenation. The same formula applies to all three PSK categories (long-term, pairing, Sentinel); the client stores each of its PSKs tagged with its category. `psk_category` declares which category the server is using the referenced PSK as - `'lt'` (long-term), `'pr'` (pairing), or `'sn'` (Sentinel) - so a match binds both sides to the same category, which determines how to proceed. The single handshake pattern (`KKpsk2`) is used in all three cases; only the PSK input differs.

The **Sentinel PSK** is a published constant used as the PSK input whenever no other PSK applies. It provides no authentication on its own (its value is public); authentication, when needed, is established later during [Pairing](pairing.md#pairing). The sentinel value is:

```
Sentinel PSK = SHA-256("sendspin-sentinel-psk-v1")
             = 0x1b5e24dbc1aed95fc2a5a338a90c05df44bd10f5ec1f4cd66cbf86272767b9d3
```

and its `psk_id` is therefore also a published constant:

```
Sentinel psk_id = 0x185b15f6d2da4909bd1dc156a4ab206103abef0153bcd52d926170b95cf7ce8a
                = base64url "GFsV9tLaSQm9HcFWpKsgYQOr7wFTvNUtkmFwuVz3zoo"
```

The client decrypts the first handshake message's payload (possible without a PSK, as noted above), compares the included `psk_id` to the hash of each candidate PSK of the declared `psk_category`, and selects the one that matches. It then mixes that PSK in to process the second handshake message. If no candidate matches, the client falls back to the Sentinel PSK (see [Sentinel Fallback](#sentinel-fallback)).

Each [long-term PSK](README.md#definitions) is persisted in a [pairing record](pairing.md#pairing-records) alongside the server's `server_id`. After a `psk_id` match, the client verifies that the matched PSK's stored `server_id` equals the one in [`server/init`](messaging.md#server--client-serverinit); mismatch fails the handshake.

### Sentinel Fallback

A `psk_id` lookup miss means the server referenced a credential the client cannot use: the client lost its pairing record (e.g., a [Factory Reset](README.md#definitions), [eviction](pairing.md#pairing-records), or storage failure), an interrupted [pairing finalize](pairing.md#server--client-serverpair-finalize) left the client without the record the server persisted, or the client holds the referenced PSK under a different category than the declared `psk_category`. On a lookup miss in the initial handshake the client completes the second handshake message with the Sentinel PSK instead of failing. The fallback applies only there: a miss during a [re-handshake](#re-handshake), and a failed stored-pubkey post-match check (a misbinding, not a miss), fail the handshake as before.

The server verifies the second handshake message against the PSK its first message referenced. If that fails and the referenced PSK was not the Sentinel, it verifies the same message against the Sentinel PSK before treating the handshake as failed. A second message that validates under the Sentinel is an authenticated **credential-mismatch signal**: the handshake authenticates the client's static key, so the signal proves its holder could not use the referenced PSK. The signal alone MUST NOT cause either side to remove or replace a record.

The session proceeds as an ordinary [unpaired](README.md#definitions) Sentinel-keyed one, except that the server MUST NOT activate roles or declare the `'playback'` activity while its pairing record exists - the session carries a [pairing](pairing.md#pairing) exchange or stays idle. The server SHOULD surface the mismatch to its operator and offer re-pairing, which replaces the record and restores normal service.

### Prologue

The prologue mixed into the Noise handshake state on both sides is the concatenation of the exact bytes of [`client/init`](messaging.md#client--server-clientinit) followed by the exact bytes of [`server/init`](messaging.md#server--client-serverinit), as transmitted on the wire (the JSON-encoded UTF-8 message body, without the WebSocket framing). This binds the cleartext init exchange to the handshake; tampering causes the handshake to fail.

Both sides MUST hash the raw message bytes exactly as sent and received, not a re-encoding of the parsed message.

### Failure Handling

A server-side failure decided from the cleartext [`client/init`](messaging.md#client--server-clientinit) alone - an unsupported `version`, an unknown `suite`, or a message that is not valid JSON of the defined shape - is an **init failure**: the server MUST send [`server/error`](messaging.md#server--client-servererror) with the matching reason, then close the connection. The message is unauthenticated, so the reason is a hint for logging and operator display.

A `client/init` that parses as JSON of the message envelope and whose `version` is an integer other than `1` is `unsupported_version` regardless of its other payload fields, since a future version may define a different shape. Every other shape failure, including input that is not valid JSON, is `malformed`; `suite` is checked after `version`, then the remaining fields.

Every other handshake-phase failure - a client-side rejection of `server/init`, a handshake timeout, a malformed inner `noise/handshake` payload, a `psk_id` lookup miss without the [Sentinel Fallback](#sentinel-fallback), Noise AEAD failure, AEAD failure once in transport mode, or a cleartext message received after switching to transport mode - is a **silent failure**: the detecting side closes the connection without sending any further message.

Implementations SHOULD apply a timeout (e.g., 30 seconds) for each side to receive the next expected message during the prologue and Noise-handshake phases.

### Re-handshake

The server MAY rerun the Noise handshake in transport mode to swap session keys without closing the WebSocket - typically to promote the session to paired after a successful [pairing](pairing.md#pairing), to switch from Sentinel to a pairing PSK, or to rotate session keys on long-running connections.

The server initiates, as in the original handshake. The two [`noise/handshake`](messaging.md#client--server-noisehandshake) messages are sent as encrypted binary messages inside the current channel; `psk_id` and `psk_category` in noise message 1 select the PSK for the new session. `client/init` and `server/init` are not re-sent - `client_id`, `server_id`, and `suite` carry over. The new handshake's prologue is the prior handshake's hash `h`. Once the new keys are in place, the server MUST send [`server/activate`](messaging.md#server--client-serveractivate) as its first message under the new keys. Neither [`server/hello`](messaging.md#server--client-serverhello) nor [`client/hello`](messaging.md#client--server-clienthello) is re-sent. That activation is a subsequent one on the same connection. The activation rules, including those for omitted `active_roles`, apply under the newly matched PSK.

The server MUST NOT start new application messages after sending Noise message 1, nor the client after receiving it, except for the handshake and `server/activate`. This restriction ends when the server sends, or the client receives, the new `server/activate`.

The server MUST tolerate valid old-key application messages received before Noise message 2, since the client may have sent them before receiving message 1. It MAY discard them without processing or responding.

Connection state, such as open streams with their buffered data or the [time filter](messaging.md#clock-synchronization), persists across a re-handshake; only the session keys and what the handshake itself derives change.
